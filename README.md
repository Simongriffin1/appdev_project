# Inbox Journal

A Rails 8 email-first AI journaling app. Receive AI-generated questions via email, reply to create journal entries, and build on your reflections over time.

## Features

- **Email-first journaling**: Receive AI-generated questions via email and reply to create entries
- **AI-generated prompts**: Two contextual questions per email based on your recent entries
- **Automatic analysis**: Entries are analyzed for summary, sentiment, emotion, and topics
- **Flexible scheduling**: Set your time zone, frequency (daily/weekdays/weekly), and send times
- **ActionMailbox integration**: Inbound emails are automatically processed and saved as entries
- **Session-based authentication**: Simple sign up and sign in (no Devise)

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Ruby 3.0 or higher
- PostgreSQL
- Bundler

### Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

2. Setup the database:
   ```bash
   bin/rails db:create
   bin/rails db:migrate
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   ```bash
   # Set OPENAI_API_KEY for AI features (optional)
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   # Or create a .env file with:
   # OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```
   
   Get your OpenAI API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   bin/server
   ```

5. Visit `http://localhost:3000`

### Local Demo with ActionMailbox Conductor

Since the app uses email for journaling, you can test the full flow locally using ActionMailbox Conductor:

1. **Sign up** for a new account at `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Complete onboarding** by setting:
   - Time zone (default: America/Chicago)
   - Email frequency (daily/weekdays/weekly)
   - Send times (comma-separated, e.g., "09:00,21:00")
3. **Send a test prompt**:
   - Click "Send me my next email now" on the dashboard
   - Or wait for the scheduled time
4. **View the outbound email**:
   - Check the Rails logs for the email content
   - Or use ActionMailbox Conductor at `/rails/conductor/action_mailbox/inbound_emails`
5. **Simulate an inbound reply**:
   - Go to `/rails/conductor/action_mailbox/inbound_emails`
   - Click "Deliver new inbound email"
   - Use the Reply-To address from the prompt email (format: `reply+TOKEN@localhost`)
   - Add your journal entry text in the body
   - Click "Deliver inbound email"
6. **View your entry**:
   - Check the dashboard to see your new journal entry
   - The entry will be automatically analyzed if `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set

### Environment Variables

**For AI features (optional but recommended):**
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key (get from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
  - Without this, the app uses fallback questions and basic analysis

**For email (optional, for production):**
- `MAIL_FROM` - Email address for sending prompts (default: "noreply@inboxjournal.com")
- `MAIL_DOMAIN` - Domain for reply-to addresses (default: "localhost" in development)

**For database:**
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string (format: `postgresql://user:pass@localhost/dbname`)

**Optional:**
- `RAILS_ENV` - Environment (default: development)
- `RAILS_MAX_THREADS` - Database connection pool size (default: 5)
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 3000)
- `WEB_CONCURRENCY` - Puma workers (default: 2)

The app works without `OPENAI_API_KEY` - it will use fallback prompts and basic analysis.

## How It Works

1. **Onboarding**: After signup, users configure their time zone, email frequency, and send times
2. **Prompt generation**: The app generates two contextual questions based on the user's last 5 journal entries
3. **Email sending**: Prompts are sent via email with a signed token in the Reply-To address
4. **Email replies**: Users reply to the email, and ActionMailbox processes the inbound message
5. **Entry creation**: Replies are saved as journal entries linked to the original prompt
6. **Analysis**: Each entry is automatically analyzed for summary, sentiment, emotion, and topics
7. **Context building**: Future prompts use the last 5 entries to generate more relevant questions

## Deployment

This app is configured for deployment on Render.

### Render Deployment

1. Connect your repository to Render
2. Create a new Web Service
3. Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` configuration
4. Environment variables are configured in `render.yaml`:
   - `DATABASE_URL` - Automatically provided by Render
   - `SECRET_KEY_BASE` - Automatically generated by Render
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Add in Render dashboard under Environment Variables
   - `RAILS_ENV` - Set to production
   - `WEB_CONCURRENCY` - Set to 2
   - `MAIL_FROM` - Set your sending email address
   - `MAIL_DOMAIN` - Set your domain for reply-to addresses

5. To add `OPENAI_API_KEY` in Render:
   - Go to your service → Environment
   - Add new environment variable: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - Enter your API key value
   - Save changes

The app uses:
- PostgreSQL (via `DATABASE_URL`)
- Puma web server
- Solid Queue for background jobs
- ActionMailbox for email processing
- Standard Rails 8 production configuration
